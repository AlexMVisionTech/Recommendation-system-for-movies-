    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "To improve user satisfaction and engagement on a movie streaming platform by providing **Top 5 personalised movie recommendations** based on users' past ratings. The goal is to simulate how platforms like Netflix and Prime Video tailor suggestions to each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "This project uses the MovieLens `ml-latest-small` dataset. It focuses on:\n",
    "- Explicit rating data (0.5 to 5.0 scale)\n",
    "- Recommending unseen movies to users\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric                 | Goal                            |\n",

    "| RMSE / MAE             | Below 1.0                        |\n",
    "| Recommendation Relevance | Top 5 suggestions match user interests |\n",
    "| Coverage               | Recommendations generated for most users |\n",
    "| Scalability            | Can extend to larger datasets or real-world scenarios |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of digital content, users are often overwhelmed by thousands of movie choices. Without a guiding system, users may miss out on films they would have enjoyed, leading to reduced satisfaction and platform engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How can we accurately recommend the Top 5 movies to a user based on their historical movie ratings using content-based filtering techniques?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build such a recommender system using content based filtering, trained on historical ratings data from MovieLens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is the `ml-latest-small` version from MovieLens, containing 100,836 ratings by 610 users across 9,742 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Files:\n",
    "- `movies.csv` – Contains `movieId`, `title`, `genres`\n",
    "- `ratings.csv` – Contains `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, `timestamp`\n",
    "- `tags.csv`  – Contains user-generated tags\n",
    "- `links.csv`  – External references (IMDb, TMDb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratings Data:\n",
    "- Ratings range from 0.5 to 5.0 in 0.5 increments\n",
    "- Explicit feedback format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removed duplicates and unnecessary fields\n",
    "- Converted data into a **user-item matrix**\n",
    "- Split data into **training and test sets**\n",
    "- Normalized data for similarity calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualized distribution of ratings\n",
    "- Identified most rated movies and most active users\n",
    "- Checked for matrix sparsity\n",
    "- Generated basic statistics to guide model design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Content-based Modelling \n",
    "\n",
    "### User-Based Content Filtering\n",
    "- Recommends movies highly rated by users\n",
    "- Finds movies similar to those the user has liked\n",
    "- More scalable and stable for sparse datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "- Precision@K, Recall@K for Top-N evaluation\n",
    "- Cross-validation for reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Top-10 Recommendation Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each user, predicted unseen ratings\n",
    "- Sorted predicted scores to get Top 10 movies\n",
    "- Filtered out already-watched titles\n",
    "- Presented recommendations in readable format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Cold Start and Hybrid Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressed new users/movies using:\n",
    "  - Genre-based content filtering\n",
    "  - Initial rating surveys\n",
    "- Hybrid approach combines content and collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Conclusion and Final Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- Developed a content filtering-based movie recommender\n",
    "- Achieved strong performance on metrics like RMSE and MAE\n",
    "- Demonstrated potential for deployment and scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work:\n",
    "- Build hybrid models with content metadata\n",
    "- Explore deep learning-based recommenders"
